               <h1>Lesson that challenge me the most</h1>
               <p>Chapter 6: HTML & CSS, is by far the most challenging lesson for me. Because I can't fully comprehend the syntax used in css
                that is why I am having a hard time in learning that lesson. But this lesson is very enjoyable because you get a chance to learn
                a skill that will eventually help me to land a job in the future.
